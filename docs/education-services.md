# Khan Academy
Offers a RESTful [API](https://github.com/Khan/khan-api/wiki/Khan-Academy-API) that gives information about the content covered by Khan Academy. Data requested is outputted in JSON.

Exercises and videos are related, so one can search for videos related to a given exercise.

Can also look at the badges awarded for exercises, which goes well with our proposed rewards system.

API also allows to authenticate for a given user to keep track of their progress. However, this would require us to set up an education account on their side. For now, we could select what exercises to consider and keep track of progress on our end.

# HackerRack
Can create challenges/contests for others to have a go at.

REST [API](https://www.hackerrank.com/api) allows one to submit their code for checking against the test cases for a given contest/challenge.

# Coding lessons
No popular service seems to provide an editable embedded coding environment. You either have to pay (codepen.io) or no API exists (Codecademy). Khan Academy does have coding lessons, but only for Javascript.

# Sandboxing
There seem to be many coding sandboxes out there, but implementing actual lessons would have to be done by ourselves.

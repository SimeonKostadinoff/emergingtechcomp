# Khan Academy
Offers a RESTful [API](https://github.com/Khan/khan-api/wiki/Khan-Academy-API) that gives information about the content covered by Khan Academy. Data requested is outputted in JSON.

Exercises and videos are related, so one can search for videos related to a given exercise.

Can also look at the badges awarded for exercises, which goes well with our proposed rewards system.

API also allows to authenticate for a given user to keep track of their progress. However, this would require us to set up an education account on their side. For now, we could select what exercises to consider and keep track of progress on our end.
